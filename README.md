I tried to connect to the server many times because of the network, and because the file was too big, it would crash every time I run it on the server. So I configured the environment to run locally.Because I can not upload files more than 25M to github there are data sets,so I compress them into zip including  ipynb files,data sets, and generated html files to view the results of the operation.
